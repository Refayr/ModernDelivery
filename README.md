# The Art and Science of Modern Delivery: From Factory to Final Mile

## Context
In an era where speed, reliability, and sustainability are critical, the efficiency of delivery networks—from factory to supply depot, and ultimately to the end customer—is a cornerstone of global commerce. The rise of e-commerce, automation, and real-time tracking technologies has transformed traditional logistics, pushing businesses to innovate continuously.
_How can companies optimize their delivery processes to balance cost, technology, and environmental impact while maintaining seamless logistics?_

The answer lies in leveraging data-driven strategies: _automation, predictive analytics, and alternative delivery methods_ (such as drones and autonomous vehicles). This project explores the journey of goods through the supply chain and investigates cutting-edge solutions to enhance delivery efficiency, reduce operational costs, and minimize environmental footprints.

## Aim and Objectives

### Aim
_Optimize the delivery process from factory to customer_ by integrating data analytics and PostgreSQL database management.

### Objectives
_At this point, objectives may change regarding to the usability of the datasets._
+ _Route Optimization_: Minimize delivery times and maximize cargo load efficiency for each delivery vector (trucks, drones, etc.).
+ _Inventory Management_: Ensure optimal stock levels in supply depots to prevent stockouts and overstocking, aligning with demand forecasts.
+ _Sustainability Integration_: Explore eco-friendly delivery methods and technologies to reduce carbon emissions, in line with France’s and the EU’s environmental goals.

## Datasets
To achieve these objectives, the following datasets could be utilized to build a comprehensive logistics database:

+ [Logistics and Supply Chain Dataset]("https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasetengineer/logistics-and-supply-chain-dataset") – Focuses on shipment tracking, delivery times, and supply chain efficiency metrics.
+ [Delivery Logistics Dataset]("https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayeshaseherr/delivery-logistics-dataset") – Contains data on delivery routes, timings, and performance indicators, useful for route optimization and last-mile delivery analysis.
+ [Transportation and Logistics Tracking Dataset]("https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nicolemachado/transportation-and-logistics-tracking-dataset") – Includes real-time tracking data for shipments, ideal for studying transportation efficiency and delays.
+ [Amazon Delivery Dataset]("https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujalsuthar/amazon-delivery-dataset") – Focuses on last-mile logistics and delivery performance, with insights into delivery times, distances, and customer satisfaction.
+ [Logistics Shipment On-Time Delivery Classification Dataset]("https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sezginkaraglle/logistics-dataset") – Useful for predictive modeling to determine on-time delivery probabilities based on historical data.
